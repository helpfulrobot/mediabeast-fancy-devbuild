# A Fancy SilverStripe dev/build Tool
Simple SilverStripe module to trigger a dev/build via ajax in the CMS. 
This will allow you to close that extra tab that we all keep open just for dev/build.

### Installation
Composer is the recommended way of installing SilverStripe modules
```json
require: "mediabeast/fancy-devbuild": "1.*"
```
