# A Fancy SilverStripe dev/build Tool
Simple SilverStripe module to trigger a dev/build via ajax in the CMS. 
This will allow you to have one less tab open if your like me and always have a dev/build tab open...

#### Early ideas
I'm thinking it will be a small button located somewhere in the CMS that's always visable. 
Once clicked it will show loading progress of the dev/build (circle icon maybe?) and then refresh the current page.
Or possibly instead of reloading straight a second click on the icon will reload the page.
